This project is to develop glue code to integrate with test subjects' existing Junit code. Most test subjects' Junit test code doesn't separate 
individual test cases. All test cases are combined together into one big test suite hence no way to select individual test case for regression(RTS).
This project is developed with Java 1.6 and Junit 3.8.1 for compatibility purpose. This project applies adapter design pattern.
